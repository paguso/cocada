/**

COCADA implements a simplified Trait mechanism. A Trait (interface)
consists in a set of methods to be implemented by an object, called
the *implementor*. Usually a traits only declares the method, being
the responsability of the object to provide an implementation. Thus
trait methods are usually **virtual** methods, although the trait
may also provide a default implementation.

To illustrate, letÂ´s suppose we what to implement a trait `shape`
with two methods
- `dimension get_dim(shape *)`
- `void draw(shape *, canvas *)`
and suppose that we want to implement types `circle`, and `rectangle`
that implement this trait. Our intent is to be able to write something
like

```C
circle *c = circle_new(100, 100, 50); // x_origin, y_origin, radius
rectangle *r = rectangle_new(5, 10, 40, 90) // x_bot_left, y_bot_left, x_top_right, y_top_right
dimension dc = dimension(c);
dimension dr = dimension(r);
printf("circle: width=%d height=%d\n", dc.width, dc.height); // prints circle: width=100 height=100
printf("rectangle: width=%d height=%d\n", dr.width, dr.height); // prints rectangle: width=35 height=80
draw(c);
draw(r);
```

obviously, the dimensions are calculated differently depending on
the actual shape, and similarly for the `draw` method to display
the shapes on screen.


# Defining a Trait

A trait is declared in a file `trait.h` with some "glue" code given
in `trait.c`.

In our current example the file `shape.h` would be something like

```C
typedef struct _shape shape;

typedef struct {
    dimension (*get_dim) (void *);
    void (*draw)(void *, canvas *);
} shape_vt;

struct _shape {
  void *impltor;
  shape_vt vt;
}

dimension shape_get_dim(shape *);
void shape_draw(shape *, canvas *);
```

Every object implementing the
